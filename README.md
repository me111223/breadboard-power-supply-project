# breadboard-power-supply-project
This project is a compact and reliable power supply module designed to plug directly into a standard breadboard (MB102). It provides stable DC voltage for electronic prototyping and hobbyist projects.


Key Features:

- Breadboard Compatible: Specifically designed to fit standard breadboard power rails.

- Dual Voltage Support: [Write your output voltages, e.g., Switchable 3.3V / 5V output].

- Input Connector: DC Barrel Jack (2.1mm) for external power adapters.

- Status Indicator: Integrated Power LED to show the current operating state.



Hardware Overview:

- The design focuses on simplicity and efficiency using the following key components:

- Voltage Regulators: [e.g., AMS1117 Series]

- Capacitors: Electrolytic and Ceramic for stable ripple filtering.

- Switching: [Mention any jumpers or slide switches used for voltage selection].
